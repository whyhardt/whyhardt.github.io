  <div style="text-align: justify;">I am PhD Student and research associate in the Automated Discovery of Human Mind and Brain Lab at the <a href="https://www.ikw.uni-osnabrueck.de/en/home.html">Institute of Cognitive Science</a> (Osnabrueck University).</div>

<br><br>
I am dedicated to making science and especially cognitive science more accessible and transparent, particularly for young researchers like myself. That's why I chose to pursue my PhD under the guidance of <a href="https://smusslick.com/">Sebastian Musslick</a> and contribute to the mission of the <a href="https://musslick.github.io/AER_website/Research.html">Autonomous Empirical Research Group</a> accelerating scientific research of human cognition through the help of artificial intelligence and thus helping scientists becoming more productive.
<br><br>
During my academic and professional career, I came across many different subjects. Initially, I graduated in Electrical Engineering and Information Technology from the University of Stuttgart. Throughout my engineering education, I had different jobs at companies like Porsche and Bosch, where I gained invaluable experience from learning about system dynamics and engineering mathematics to implementing automatic data processing pipelines and developing simulation models. My research projects concentrated on programming interfaces for data acquisition and applying AI algorithms for the generation of e.g. altitude profiles for simulated car tracks or the hybrid electro-thermal simulation of lithium battery packs. All these experiences helped me to find my passion in inventing new ways of leveraging artificial intelligence for responsible applications.
<br><br>
And talking about responsible applications brings me to my current research field of interest - cognitive science! Despite my classic engineering background, I found myself more and more interested in the intrecating processes of the human mind. For that reason I sought during the final phase of my master degree to get to know this research domain. My master thesis was located at the interjunction of AI and human cognition, developing an automated coach for training participants in excersising their cognitive control in everyday's situations.
<br><br>
After that I knew that I want to pursue this direction which led me to my current PhD position advancing scientific practice through AI-based automation.
