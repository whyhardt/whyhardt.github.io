As a PhD Student and research associate in the Computational Neuroscience Group at Osnabrueck University's [Institute of Cognitive Science](https://www.ikw.uni-osnabrueck.de/en/home.html), I am deeply committed to fostering responsible and transparent research practices. This conviction stems from my belief that such principles are essential pillars of our global community. In pursuit of this goal, I am dedicated to making science more accessible and transparent, particularly for young researchers like myself. That's why I chose to pursue my PhD under the guidance of [Sebastian Musslick](https://smusslick.com/) and contribute to the mission of the [Autonomous Empirical Research Group](https://musslick.github.io/AER_website/Research.html) accelerating scientific inquiry leveraging artificial intelligence and thus helping scientists becoming more productive.

My journey to this point has been marked by diverse experiences and transitions. Initially, I graduated in Electrical Engineering and Information Technology from the University of Stuttgart. Throughout my engineering education and taken jobs at esteemed companies like Porsche and Bosch, I gained invaluable experience from learning about system dynamics and engineering mathematics to implementing automatic data processing pipelines and developing simulation models. All these experiences helped me to find my passion in inventing new ways of leveraging artificial intelligence for responsible applications.

Despite my proficiency in engineering, I felt a pull towards a new domain during the final phase of my graduate program. This prompted me to immerse myself in the cognitive sciences, a field previously unfamiliar to me. Here, I discovered a new avenue to utilize my accumulated knowledge by contributing to our understanding of human behavior.
