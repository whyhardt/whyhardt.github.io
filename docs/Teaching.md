In my teaching philosophy, I believe in transcending traditional, teacher-centered methods towards a more dynamic and practical approach. Rather than simply lecturing, I advocate for a hybrid learning model where students engage actively in exercises and applications. By incorporating hands-on experiences, such as programming tutorials, students not only absorb theoretical knowledge but also immediately apply it in real-world scenarios. This approach fosters a deeper understanding of concepts and enhances problem-solving skills. My goal is to empower students to become active participants in their own learning journey, equipping them with the tools and confidence to tackle challenges independently and creatively.

## Courses
### Basic Programming in Python

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br>
In my Basic Programming in Python course tailored for cognitive science students with limited or no prior programming experience, I aim to introduce fundamental coding principles and the Python programming language. Students are encouraged not only to passively absorb the provided information but also to actively apply their learning in progressively challenging tasks. Through hands-on exercises and projects, they are led step-by-step into the world of coding and scientific computing, gradually building their skills while exploring different applications of programming. By the end of the course, students leverage their new programming skills to construct their own cognitive model of human decision-making. This involves integrating the hypothesis of noisy evidence-accumulation through a drift-diffusion model, fostering their problem-solving skills in realm of programming.

### Optimizing Experimental Design

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br>
In the *Optimizing Experiment Design* course, students delve into the intricacies of adaptive design for behavioral experiments. Through comprehensive instruction, they gain proficiency in crafting experiments that are not only informative but also data-efficient. The course fosters direct engagement with contemporary cognitive science research, as students tackle experiment design challenges and validate hypotheses through different experiment design approaches learning about the respective benefits and drawbacks. This course navigates students through topics ranging from factorial experimental design over different random sampling strategies to get to know baseline experimentation techniques to active learning methodologies like uncertainty based design and Bayesian experimental design. During all coding challenges the students leverage their Python programming skills to implement and refine experimental designs with the introduced approaches. In the end of the course, students are collaborating in groups over a certain period of time to address complex problem sets, applying and comparing the presented experimental design principles showcasing the respective differences over a range of problem sets.
