This conviction stems from my belief that such principles are essential pillars of our global community. </p>  In pursuit of this goal, I am dedicated to making science more accessible and transparent, particularly for young researchers like myself. That's why I chose to pursue my PhD under the guidance of Sebastian Musslick and contribute to the mission of the Autonomous Empirical Research Group accelerating scientific inquiry leveraging artificial intelligence and thus helping scientists becoming more productive.  My journey to this point has been marked by diverse experiences and transitions. Initially, I graduated in Electrical Engineering and Information Technology from the University of Stuttgart. Throughout my engineering education and taken jobs at esteemed companies like Porsche and Bosch, I gained invaluable experience from learning about system dynamics and engineering mathematics to implementing automatic data processing pipelines and developing simulation models. All these experiences helped me to find my passion in inventing new ways of leveraging artificial intelligence for responsible applications.  Despite my proficiency in engineering, I felt a pull towards a new domain during the final phase of my graduate program. This prompted me to immerse myself in the cognitive sciences, a field previously unfamiliar to me. Here, I discovered a new avenue to utilize my accumulated knowledge by contributing to our understanding of human behavior."},{"location":"Publications/","title":"Publications","text":""},{"location":"Publications/#articles","title":"Articles","text":"<p>Williams, C.

My research projects range from applications like an autonomous coach for training ones cognitive control in everyday's working scenarios to making neuroscience more efficient by augmenting EEG data saving resources like time and money and reserving scientists more capacity for the creative part. My current PhD project contributes directly to the mission of the Autonomous Empirical Research Group by implementing a framework for the automated research of human reinforcement learning in a closed loop without the need for human intervention."},{"location":"ResearchInterest/#automated-scientific-discovery-of-human-cognition","title":"Automated scientific discovery of human cognition","text":"The potential of automating scientific practice is becoming increasingly recognized as a novel paradigm for scientific discovery within the natural sciences, ranging from the prediction of protein folding to the automated synthesis of novel materials. Yet, approaches to automating scientific discovery have, so far, evaded cognitive science\u2014in part, because human behavior is noisy and results from complex cognitive dynamics that are unobservable. In my PhD, I seek to develop a closed-loop machine learning framework for automating the discovery of latent dynamics underlying human reinforcement learning. The framework integrates computational model discovery, optimal experimental design, and web-based data collection into a closed-loop system for empirical research, and provides the basis for automated behavioral laboratories. Preliminary results indicate that this framework is capable of recovering a broad class of human reinforcement learning models from noisy behavioral data. During my PhD, I will continue to pilot this system for the data-driven discovery of novel scientific models of human reinforcement learning, and explore its generalizability to explain models of human decision making. The general methodology is inspired by successful applications of automated scientific discovery in the natural sciences and has the potential to significantly accelerate the study of human cognition and behavior, while enhancing transparency and replicability of behavioral research."},{"location":"ResearchInterest/#eeg-data-augmentation","title":"EEG data augmentation","text":"There is major potential for using electroencephalography (EEG) in brain decoding that has been untapped due to the need for large amounts of data. Advances in machine learning have mitigated this need through data augmentation techniques, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Here, we gauged the extent to which GANs can augment EEG data to enhance classification performance. Our objectives were to determine which classifiers benefit from GAN-augmented EEG and to estimate the impact of sample sizes on GAN-enhancements. We investigated three classifiers\u2014neural networks, support vector machines, and logistic regressions\u2014 across seven sample sizes ranging from 5 to 100 participants. GAN-augmented EEG enhanced classification for neural networks and support vector machines, but not logistic regressions. Further, GAN-enhancements diminished as sample sizes increased\u2014suggesting it is most effective with small samples, which may facilitate research that is unable to collect large amounts of data."},{"location":"ResearchInterest/#creating-an-adaptive-and-autonomous-cognitive-control-coach","title":"Creating an adaptive and autonomous cognitive control coach","text":"In the pursuit of long-term goals like learning new skills or advancing in career paths, individuals often face the challenge of navigating through distractions prevalent in the digital world. These distractions, promising quick rewards, can derail efforts towards achieving these aspirations, demanding significant cognitive control to resist. However, the development of this cognitive control skill is feasible through training and by integrating an artificial cognitive control coach into our daily life we can effectively foster this skill. This coach provides feedback to a person based on their training history and current cognitive state, utilizing an Actor-Critic reinforcement learning architecture. This setup proves valuable in enhancing cognitive control, even though the exact amount exerted cannot be directly measured. The coach, in this case the critic, assesses the value of the current cognitive state without knowing the exact amount of cognitive control and returns its feedback to the individual, in this case the actor. That way, a multitude of cognitive mechanisms like mental fatigue over time, the value of learning or reward-driven distractibility can be considered in that evaluation leading to an adaptive and autonomous cognitive control coach."},{"location":"Teaching/","title":"Teaching","text":"In my teaching philosophy, I believe in transcending traditional, teacher-centered methods towards a more dynamic and practical approach. Rather than simply lecturing, I advocate for a hybrid learning model where students engage actively in exercises and applications. By incorporating hands-on experiences, such as programming tutorials, students not only absorb theoretical knowledge but also immediately apply it in real-world scenarios. This approach fosters a deeper understanding of concepts and enhances problem-solving skills. My goal is to empower students to become active participants in their own learning journey, equipping them with the tools and confidence to tackle challenges independently and creatively."},{"location":"Teaching/#courses","title":"Courses","text":""},{"location":"Teaching/#basic-programming-in-python","title":"Basic Programming in Python","text":"In my Basic Programming in Python course tailored for cognitive science students with limited or no prior programming experience, I aim to introduce fundamental coding principles and the Python programming language. Students are encouraged not only to passively absorb the provided information but also to actively apply their learning in progressively challenging tasks. Through hands-on exercises and projects, they are led step-by-step into the world of coding and scientific computing, gradually building their skills while exploring different applications of programming. By the end of the course, students leverage their new programming skills to construct their own cognitive model of human decision-making.
